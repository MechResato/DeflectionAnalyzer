This project implements a simple least-squares polynomial fit routine written in C and also provides a very simple example of how to use CppUTest in a project.

The "CppUTest" framework (https://cpputest.github.io/) is used for testing and is bundled into the Makefile.  Running "make" results in a compilation as well as test of the polyfit() routine.

See "test_polyfit.cpp" for an example of how to call the polyfit() routine if you are not interested in the CppUTest portions.
